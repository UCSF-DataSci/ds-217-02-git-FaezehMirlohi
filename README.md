## **iii Brief introduction**
My name is Faezeh, and I am a medical graduate with a strong interest in computer science and programming. After graduation, I became interested in the intersection of medicine and AI, which has led me to pursue a master's in Health Data Science at UCSF. My goal is to transition into the industry, focusing on health data science and AI in medicine.
I’ve taken a basic Python course, but I don’t yet have experience with data science libraries, Git, or GitHub. I’m particularly excited to learn about libraries like Pandas and NumPy and algorithms in this course.
